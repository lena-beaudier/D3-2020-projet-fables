<section id="section02">
<p>We must understand by Aesop's fables those attributed to him and all kinds of stories that circulated before him orally and with the same characteristics1.
The first historically attested collection of Aesop's fables was compiled by Demetrios of Phalera in the 4th century BC. AD, more than two hundred years after the death of Aesop. This collection is lost, but it has given birth to countless versions. The most important is the collection called Augustana, which has more than 500 fables, all in prose. In his critical edition of this collection, Chambry retained 358 fables.</p>

<p>
A wolf, seeing a lamb drinking from a river, wanted to make a specious pretext for devouring it. That is why, although he was upstream himself, he accused him of disturbing the water and preventing him from drinking. The lamb replied that he drank only from the tip of his lips, and besides, being downstream, he could not disturb the water upstream. The wolf, having lost its effect, continued: "But last year you insulted my father. "I wasn't even born then," replied the lamb. Then the wolf continued, "No matter how easy it is to justify yourself, I will eat you no less. "

This fable shows that with people determined to do evil the fairest defense has no effect.</p>

  <p>A bull pursued by a lion took refuge in a den where there were wild goats. Hit and gored by them, he said to them, "If I endure your blows, it is not that I am afraid of you, but I am afraid of the one standing at the entrance to the cave. "

This is how often the fear of a stronger one makes us endure the outrages of a less strong one than us.</p>

    <h3>3- The bat and the weasel.</h3>

  </figure>
  <p>A bat, having fallen to the ground, was taken by a weasel. Seeing herself on the verge of being killed, she asked for life. The weasel told her that she could not let go; for she was by nature the enemy of all birds. The bat replied that it was not a bird itself, but a mouse, and it got away with it. Afterwards, having fallen a second time, she was taken by another weasel, and begged her not to eat her. When she replied that she hated all mice, the bat claimed that it was not itself a mouse, but a bat, and it was released again this time. It so happened that on two occasions, by changing her name, she escaped death.

This fable shows that we should not always stick to the same means, but remember that by adapting to circumstances, we often escape danger..</p>

<p>
The lion and the donkey, having tied part together, had gone out to hunt. Having arrived at a cave where there were wild goats, the lion stood at the entrance to watch their exit, and the donkey, having entered inside, began to leap among them and bray to scare them away. When the lion had taken most of it, the donkey came out and asked him if he had not bravely fought and pushed the goats out, "Know well," replied the lion, "that you would have scared me. - even if I hadn't known you were a donkey. "

This is how people who boast in front of those who know them are in fact a mockery.</p>

  <p>The old lion was lying sick in his den, and all the animals had come to visit their prince except the fox. Then the wolf, seizing the favorable opportunity, accused the fox before the lion: "he had no regard for him who was the master of all of them, and that is why he did not look at him. hadn't even come to visit him. In the meantime the fox arrived too, and he heard the wolf's last words. Then the lion roared against the fox. But the latter, having asked for a moment to justify himself: "And who," he said, "among all those gathered here, has rendered you as great a service as I, who went everywhere to ask the doctors for a remedy for heal you, and who found it? The lion asked him to say immediately what this remedy was. The fox succeeds: "It is to skin a wolf alive, and to cover you with its warm skin. The wolf was immediately put to death, and the fox said with a laugh: "The master must not be stirred up to malice, but to meekness,"
This fable shows that by setting a trap for another one sets a trap for oneself.</p>

  <p>Une tortue pria un aigle de lui apprendre à voler. L’aigle lui remontrant qu’elle n’était pas faite pour le vol, loin de là ! elle n’en devint que plus pressante en sa prière. Alors il la prit dans ses serres, l’enleva en l’air, puis la lâcha. La tortue tomba sur des rochers et fut fracassée.

Cette fable montre que souvent, en voulant rivaliser avec d’autres, en dépit des plus sages conseils, on se fait tort à soi-même.</p>
